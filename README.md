# Intro to Unit Testing with PyTest - Practice

## Directions
This directory contains three subdirectories containing code challenges:
  * `fizzbuzz`
  * `missing_number`
  * `array_pair_sum`
  * `largest_continuous_sum`

For each of these challenges, you will:
  1. Create a test file (`*_test.py` or `test_*.py`) and write at test suite of at least 3 tests. **Hint:** Turn your _E_'s from your PEDAC into unit tests.
  2. _After_ you've written your test, your will solve the problem in your main python file. Your goal is to write a function that gets all of your tests to pass. ðŸ˜Ž
  3. When all of your tests are passing, push your changes and open a PR.
