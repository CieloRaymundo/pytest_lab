# Intro to Unit Testing with PyTest - Practice

## Directions
This directory contains four subdirectories containing code challenges:
  * `fizzbuzz`
  * `missing_number`
  * `array_pair_sum`
  * `largest_continuous_sum`

For each of these challenges, you will:
  1. Create a test file (`*_test.py` or `test_*.py`) and write at test suite of at least 3 tests. 
    **Hint:** Turn your _E_'s from your PEDAC into unit tests.

  2. _After_ you've written your test, your will solve the problem in your main python file. Your goal is to write a function that gets all of your tests to pass. ðŸ˜Ž
  3. When all of your tests are passing, push your changes and open a PR.

We will do the first one together. As a group, we will:
  1. Install _PyTest_
  2. Create our test file using a `*_test.py` or `test_*.py` naming convention.
  3. Write our tests
  4. Run our tests using the `pytest` command
  5. Create our main python file.
  6. Write a function that gets our tests to pass
  7. Import our function into our test file using an `import` statement
  8. Run our tests to ensure they all pass.
